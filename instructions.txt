    type 'python ./enemy_input.py'
    Access options from the main menu

To edit encounter generation weights:
    this would be used to make pierce not contribute as much to difficulty, or make status effects count as being more powerful

    the difficulty scales are lines 7-12, change any of the algebraic statements
    save the file and run generate_encounter again (see above)
